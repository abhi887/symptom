                Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is defined as illness caused by
                a novel coronavirus now called severe acute respiratory syndrome
                coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2; formerly called 2019-nCoV), which was
                first identified amid an outbreak of respiratory illness cases in
                Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China.It was initially reported to the WHO
                on December 31, 2019. On January 30, 2020, the WHO declared the COVID-19
                outbreak a global health emergency.On March 11, 2020, the WHO declared
                COVID-19 a global pandemic, its first such designation since declaring
                H1N1 influenza a pandemic in 2009. Illness caused by SARS-CoV-2 was recently
                termed COVID-19 by the WHO, the new acronym derived from "coronavirus disease 2019. "

                <h3>How it spreads</h3>
                Coronavirus disease spreads primarily through contact
                with an infected person when they cough or sneeze.
                It also spreads when a person touches a surface or object
                that has the virus on it, then touches their eyes, nose, or mouth.
